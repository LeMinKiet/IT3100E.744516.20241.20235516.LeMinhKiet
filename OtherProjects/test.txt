Okay, keep this but more information
Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist who made significant contributions to the field of radioactivity. Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, she moved to Paris to pursue her education, earning degrees in physics and mathematics. Curie's groundbreaking work led to the discovery of the elements polonium and radium, and she coined the term "radioactivity."

In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing it with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their research on radiation. In 1911, she received a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discoveries and studies on radium and polonium. Curie founded the Radium Institute (now the Curie Institute) in Paris, which became a leading center for scientific research.

Despite facing many challenges, including gender bias and personal tragedies, Curie's dedication to science remained unwavering. Her work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and medicine, particularly in the treatment of cancer through radiation therapy. Marie Curie's legacy continues to inspire scientists around the world, demonstrating the profound impact of scientific discovery on society. She passed away on July 4, 1934, due to aplastic anemia, likely caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation during her research.
Marie Curie, born Maria Skłodowska, was the youngest of five children. Her parents were both teachers, and they instilled a strong value for education in their children. Despite the oppressive political climate and limited educational opportunities for women in Poland, Curie excelled in her studies. She moved to Paris in 1891 to continue her education at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics.
Curie's research focused on understanding the mysterious rays that were being emitted by certain elements. She hypothesized that the rays came from the atomic structure of the elements themselves, a groundbreaking concept at the time. Her work led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium (named after her native Poland) and radium, both of which exhibited intense radioactive properties.
Marie married Pierre Curie in 1895, and they formed a formidable scientific partnership. Together, they conducted extensive research on radioactive substances. They had two daughters, Irène and Ève. Irène went on to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, continuing the family's legacy of scientific excellence.
During World War I, Curie recognized the potential of X-ray technology to assist in medical treatment on the battlefield. She developed mobile X-ray units, known as "Little Curies," and trained nurses to use them, significantly improving the treatment of wounded soldiers.
